Update history:
I was able to send transaction to the Contract and add fund through the addFund () payable function.
The frontend able to intereact with backend and check the password. All other features are implemented as instructed.

How to test:

1. click withdraw, js will first check whether your address is valid, if not, account[1] will poped as example.

2. input password, if input not right, the correct pwd will poped.

3. when final withdraw, contract balance will be checked.If no balance is deposited, system will add 1 ether from account[0]

4. Then all the deposit will be send to receiver.
